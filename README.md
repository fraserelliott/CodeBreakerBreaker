CodeBreaker Breaker (v1.0.0) by Fraser Elliott aka FraserNotFrasier

# What is this?

Persona 1 has a version of CodeBreaker where you need to enter 9 unique numbers across a 3x3 board. The numbers in the H column/row are how many are in the correct position, and the numbers in the B column/row are how many are in that row/column but are not exactly in the correct position.
